# a-game-of-fish
t looks so easy but it is not really that easy as you expect.

To access music, press the space. To move, press the arrows. To beat the game, you have to take the potion by just moving to it and touching the potion. You aim your arrow at the shark and press 'h' to throw the potion. This will make the shark mad, so you have to run from it and also trick it. Both you and the shark lose 0.5 HP when you run into the pufferfish, so it is like a weapon. But, If you touch the shark, you lose 1.0 HP. You only have 3 HP. If it goes to 0, you will lose your score. If the shark's score is 0, you will win and earn 2 points that add up to your score. If you ever want to replay, press the green flag.

If you want new skins, your score has to be ten or more. Then, the button will automatically pop up. If you press it, you can change the octopus's skin. When you reach 20 points, you will have a little robot pet. The controls for it are 8, 4, 6, and 2.

When you finally reach a score of 24 or 26, you will get a button saying 'new game'. When you press it, there will be no characters. You have to press 'new pet' to unlock the character. It will automatically tell you the instructions.

When your score is 100, you will be automatically congratulated. If you go above that, you can try to beat my high score before you die in the game.

Warning though. If you die, you lose your score, not your high score, and you will lose all your skins and your pet and new game. You will have to restart.
